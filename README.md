# PolymorphicExample
program from C# and .Net book

C# 6.0 and the .NET 4.6 Framework Andrew Troelsen, Philip Japikse

The purpose of this program is to show polymorphic behavior in C#. 

Since the book goes in steps to show the eveloution of the program I decided that I will upload each step to show how they are different. So with each push its a different update to the program.
